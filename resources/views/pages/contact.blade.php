            It’s easy to have FAITH everything is going to work out, when everything IS working out.
            It’s much harder to have faith when you are facing challenges in your life. But that is exactly when you need to apply your faith.

            Because faith is believing in the unseen.  Faith is taking the first step.  Faith is jumping in the deep end and KNOWING everything will be OK.
